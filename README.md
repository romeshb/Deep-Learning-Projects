Deep_Learning_projects

This is a small Deep learning project to classify Cats and Dogs.
Dataset taken from Kaggle: 
Training, Test and Validation Data taken from here:https://www.kaggle.com/tongpython/cat-and-dog

Trained Model saved in .h5 to use anytime again, without the need to train again. Just load the .h5 model file and predict.

to check if the model is working we can use a different Dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/waifuai/cat2dog

Thanks.
